# Authentication and Authorization in Blazor Applications
Fully functioning finished sample code for my Authentication and Authorization in Blazor Applications course.  

This repo is focused on using a variety of best practice techniques for authentication and authorization, including but not limited to logging and out of your Blazor application with cookies; working with ASP.NET Core Identity; implementing token-based security with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (using IdentityServer4), and dealing with authorization (using policies).
